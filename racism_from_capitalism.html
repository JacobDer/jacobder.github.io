								You’ve likely heard somewhere, from someone, that there is a disproportionate number of black and hispanic people incarcerated in the US “because they commit more crimes than anyone else.” It’s perhaps the most typical argument used by deniers of institutionalized racism to explain away the numbers, and it falls just short of assigning propensity for crime to skin color. And, this argument holds a certain amount of validity, even if in a naive way: below is an illustration from the US Department of Justice depicting incarceration rates per 100,000 US residents by race/ethnicity.
								<span class = "image featured"><center><img src="images/p18_sum.jpg" alt="" style = "width:40%"/></center></span>
								Clearly Hispanic people are incarcerated at a consistently higher rate than white people, and black people at a rate higher than both. So what?
								</p>
								<p>
								There are people who will end their analysis here and conclude that black and brown people are simply incapable of acting in a civilized way, a natural conclusion in their eyes and minds. Alternatively, there are those whose brains are actually attached to their spinal cords, who might take this conclusion as a definition of racism. Among the latter group of people, what the root causes of the disproportionate incarceration of black and brown people are is still a point of contention, but if you ask your run-of-the-mill liberal what they believe, they’ll likely just chalk it up to white supremacy and probably offer up some platitudes to let you know that they <i>get it</i>. These two factions—those who attribute the racial disparities in incarceration to racial inferiority and those who attribute it to white supremacy—constitute the the loudest voices in the US population, and have both managed to miss the point entirely.
								</p>
								<p>
								What's the point then?
								</p>
								<p>	
								Well, black and hispanic people do commit more crimes, as evidenced by the aforementioned incarceration rates. Though, this isn't to say that those doing the arresting aren’t white supremacists, because they very much are. Indeed, law enforcement and supporters of law enforcement see black and hispanic people as lowly criminals, and conflate crime rates with their skin color. The result is a sort of racist feedback loop driven by prejudice in law enforcement together with the exaggerated crime rates of black and hispanic populations. Adopting this perspective, it isn’t difficult to reason that the feedback loop could be broken in a couple of different ways. The first method would be to somehow erase prejudice from law enforcement, which would ultimately prove to be a fool’s errand, since a police officer with enough faculty to recognize their own prejudice would never have become an officer in the first place. The second method would be to somehow reduce the crime rates of black and hispanic people, which is generally derided as unfairly placing the imperative to improve on minority populations. While the dismissal of the second method is justified given the current tools, reducing crime without placing the burden of change on minority populations is an idea worth exploring, and what we'll discuss at length.
								</p>
								<p>
								Let's start with a broad question: why does anybody commit a nonviolent crime? The short answer is that they have incentive. The long answer is all the words that come after this sentence. Let’s examine a fundamental incentive for black and hispanic people—the outrageous disparity in income between black and hispanic people and other races. Using data from the United States Census Bureau, available <a href = "https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-households.html">here</a>, I’ve created the following chart, depicting the median household income by race, from 1975 to 2018. 
								<span class = "image featured"><center><img src="images/fig_1.png" style = "width:65%" alt=""/></center></span>
								It’s immediate that median white household income is and has been higher than that of other races, and than that of all races. In addition to the great disparity of income mentioned above, the US Census Bureau states <a href = "https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-148.html">here</a> that only 17.5% of all employer firms in the US were minority owned. While these facts likely don’t come as news to anybody, they’re crucial when asking ourselves why the justice system in the US is so biased against black and hispanic people.
								</p>
								<p>
								Since the white population owns the majority of businesses in the US, white people also have the power to dictate the prices of goods (necessities, commodities, etc.) for everybody. Moreover, white households have a significantly higher median income, meaning that prices of goods will be set according to the median income of their households, leaving black and hispanic households at a disadvantage. Just to be exhaustive, the graph above shows that even if prices were set according to the median income of households of all races, black and hispanic households would still be disadvantaged. The same goods that will be comfortably available to white households, in terms of economic burden, will require serious planning, sometimes even sacrifice or government aid, for black and hispanic households to obtain. With such difficulty in procuring even basic needs, the most economically deprived will look for some means of equalizing their quality of life. Some may fall prey to the "American dream" and seek to become a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_minority">model minority</a>. Others will simply take what they need, whether they can afford it or not. In this way, we can view nonviolent crimes committed by minorities, and thereby the racism that plagues all law enforcement in the US, as symptoms of a diseased economic system, in which a single race owns a vast majority of the means of production.
								</p>
								<p>
								And this disease is getting worse as time progresses. Using the same time series from the bar graph above, and performing linear regressions on the data for each racial subset of households, some insight into the future can be gained from the following visualization.
								<span class = "image featured"><center><img src = "images/fig_2.png" alt="" style = "width:65%"></center></span>
								Of note are the slopes of the regression lines—notice how the slopes of the lines corresponding to hispanic and black households are less than those of the lines corresponding to white households and households of all races. In other words, keeping in mind that the white population makes more money in general and controls the prices of goods, it isn’t at all unreasonable to conclude that black and hispanic people are getting poorer faster and being vilified for attempting to make do.
								</p>
								<p>
								Taking into consideration the inception of the US state as we know it, the dire economic status of hispanic and black people ought to come as no surprise whatsoever. In fact, it should seem as if the criminalization of certain people of color is by design. After all, in the beginning European folk traveled to the Americas, massacred the indigenous people, and began the mass transportation of African people to the Americas for the sole purpose of making them into slaves. In what started out as routine exercise in imperialism, those who were colonizing the Americas ripped control of the land from the indigenous peoples via genocide, and for over 200 years exploited black bodies like tools to cultivate their stolen ground in the name of capital gains. Even after slavery proper was made illegal, it would be replaced by sharecropping, which is closer to what we know as wage labor today, and the deplorable practice of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict_leasing">convict leasing</a>, which wasn't formally abolished until 1948 (you read that right—1948—so next time someone tries to argue that “no white person alive today ever owned slaves, no black person alive today ever was a slave; we all need to just move on,” remind them that even if they are right, someone’s parents either owned slaves or were enslaved). And although black and hispanic people are compensated for their labor today, although black people aren't enslaved, although hispanic people aren't robbed of their personal property by force, it would be erroneous to see their economic progression as anything other than a mere transition into wage slavery. They didn’t own capital 300 years ago, they don’t own capital today.
								</p>
								<p>
								And capital is really at the heart of the issue. Over the last 244 years the US has progressed admirably in a number of ways, but that the distribution of the means of production is inequitably skewed in favor of white people has been an imperturbable monolith of American capitalism upon which the entire economic model is predicated. And so absolute has white dominance over the means of production been, that nonviolent crimes like theft have become a worthwhile risk. So how are black and hispanic people supposed to overcome the deficit in capital they face? They <i>aren’t</i>. The deficit is designed to be insurmountable. In addition to simply owning most capital in the US, the white bourgeoisie (more accurately, the bourgeoisie in general) have effectively dug a mote between their capital and the hands of the poor—hands which happen to be disproportionately black and hispanic. Their defenses are the police, with all their big weaponry and legal recourses, ready to quell any rebellion by any means. Their defenses are the votes in congress they can buy with the money they steal from their employees. Their defenses are ideas entrenched in the collective psyche of the US public, a fact demonstrable by whispering the word “socialism” and watching as the most liberal democrats and the most conservative republicans pause their eternal bickering to admonish you in a united voice that “communism works in theory, but not in practice,” despite being unable to distinguish communism from socialism, much less having read a word about either. 	
								</p>
								<p>
								So what’s the point? Racism, crime, police brutality … all of these can be done away with, but they never will be so long as all capital is concentrated in any specific group of people. Until capital is owned by the masses crime will persist, and from an ethical standpoint can even be morally justifiable given a system of ethics in which self-preservation is a high moral priority.  Until then, not just police, but the entire structure of law and law enforcement will continue to be a racially biased regime of oppression. That’s the point. But from here, the discussion becomes an increasingly complicated task to find the most effective structure for society post-capitalism and the safest road there. For that discussion, you might as well just start reading Marx.
